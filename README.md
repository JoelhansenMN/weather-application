# Weather Forecast Project

## Description
- This project focused on the creation of a weather dashboard application where users can search by city and are provided with a current forecast as well as a five day forecast.  This project uses aspects of bootstrap and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Information for the application uses the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.
